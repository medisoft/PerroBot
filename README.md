## PerroBot

This project is an attempt to build an open source 3d printed robo dog. The main idea is to help me learn how to use PIDs, Inverse Kinematics, Computer Vision,
Image and Voice recognition, Voice Synthesis, create custom PCBs and whatever comes with the development of the project.

The plan is to use an ESP32 as the microcontroller, connection with WiFi for firmware updates and NRF24L01 for remote control, and eventually use a Raspberry PI to
handle most of the machine learning and automation of the robot.
